## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used `clamp()` function. I'm not very good at using `vw` unit, but it worked well.

```css
.header__desc {
  font-size: clamp(1rem, calc(.3rem + 1vw), 1.5rem);
  margin-top: 1.625rem;
  color: var(--grayish-blue);
}
```

I learned CSS Grid by [this course](https://cssgrid.io/) and [this article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/). And I use Grid layout to create responsive website. When smaller than 500px, only 1 column, and then 2 column, when larger than 1200px, using a special grid layout like this:

![grid-design](./images/grid-design.png)

```css
.main {
  margin-top: 76px;
  display: grid;
  gap: 1.25rem;
  align-items: stretch;
  /* max-width: 385px;
  margin-inline: auto; */
  margin-inline: auto;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 500px) {
  .main {
    max-width: 846px;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
  .main {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 1fr);
    max-width: 1000px;
    /* margin-inline: auto; */
  }
```

the description in card has different line numbers. Leading to different height. I fixed it to 2 line height and 30ch width so always the same.(*But if the text exceeds two lines, there will still be problems, but I finally decided to do it this way. If there is a better way, please tell me*)

### Continued development

more and more responsive knowledge!
